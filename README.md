# EXCEL-DATA-MANIPULATION
This program was created for a start-up company.
The program has a file for all of its customers and an editable file for the patronizing customers of the week.
It collects the name of the patronizing customers and returns a .xls file or .csv file with the customers name, phone number and other informations.
If the customer is not in the database, it returns empty string for all other details
The database is gotten directly from the gmail google contact spreadsheet.
